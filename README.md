Developing a solution keeping in mind the need to enhance the primary sector of Indian agriculture. 
## problem
Farmers are facing difficulties with wild plants in the initial stage of planting. Plants in the early growth phase are heavily competing for their nutrition and water. And often this phase is crucial for plant to prevail against all other seedlings. Most of the sensitive plants are ruined off at the initial phase due to lack of water and nutrition. However, the farmers take care of manure & irrigation. At very initial phase we can't detect & distinguish between plants and weed with our necked eyes. We would develop a model that is able to classify the correct species given an image with seedlings. If we would be able to detect wild plants in early phase, then we remove them manually which is an advantage for crop production.
